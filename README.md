# rally-eventdata-track

Repository containing a Rally track for simulating event-based data use-cases. The track supports bulk indexing of auto-generated events as well as simulated Kibana queries and a range of management operations to make the track self-contained.

This track can be used as-is, extended or adapted to better match your use case or simply be used as a example of how custom parameter sources and runners can be used to create more complex and realistic simulations and benchmarks.

## Installation

Once Rally has been configured, modify the `rally.ini` file to link to the eventdata track repository:

```
[tracks]
default.url = https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks
eventdata.url = https://github.com/elastic/rally-eventdata-track

```

The track can be run by specifying the following runtime parameters: `--track=eventdata` and `--track-repository=eventdata`

Another option is to download the repository and point to it using the `--track-path` command line parameter.

## Available Challenges

### 1) append-no-conflicts

This is the default challenge, which performs bulk indexing at maximum throughput against a single index for a period of 20 minutes.

### 2) bulk-size-evaluation

This challenge performs bulk-indexing against a single index with varying bulk request sizes, ranging from 125 events/request to 50000 events/request.

### 3) shard-sizing

This challenge indexes 2 million events into an index consisting of a single shard 25 times. After each group of 2 million events has been inserted, 4 different Kibana dashboard configurations are benchmarked against the index. At this time no indexing takes place. There are two different dashboards being simulated, aggregating across 50% and 90% of the data in the shard.

This challenge shows how shard sizing can be performed and how the nature of queries used can impact the results.

### 4) elasticlogs-1bn-load

This challenge indexes 1 billion events into a number of indices of 2 primary shards each, and results in around 200GB of indices being generated on disk. This can vary depending on the environment. It can be used give an idea of how max indexing performance behaves over an extended period of time.

### 5) elasticlogs-querying

This challenge runs mixed Kibana queries against the index created in the **elasticlogs-1bn-load** track. No concurrent indexing is performed.

### 6) combined-indexing-and-querying

This challenge assumes that the *elasticlogs-1bn-load* track has been executed as it simulates querying against these indices. It shows how indexing and querying through simulated Kibana dashboards can be combined to provide a more realistic benchmark.

In this challenge rate-limited indexing at varying levels is combined with a fixed level of querying. If metrics from the run are stored in Elasticsearch, it is possible analyse these in Kibana in order to identify how indexing rate affects query latency and vice versa.

### 7) elasticlogs-continuous-index-and-query

This challenge is suitable for long term execution and runs in two phases. Both phases (`p1`, `p2`) index documents containing auto-generated event, however, `p1` indexes events at the max possible speed, whereas `p2` throttles indexing to a specified rate and in parallel executes four queries simulating Kibana dashboards and queries. The created index gets rolled over after the configured max size and the maximum amount of rolled over indices are also configurable.

The table below shows the track parameters that can be adjusted along with default values:

| Parameter | Explanation | Type | Default Value |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------- |
| `number_of_replicas` | Number of index replicas | `int` | `0` |
| `shard_count` | Number of primary shards | `int` | `2` |
| `p1_bulk_indexing_clients` | Number of [clients](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/track.html?highlight=number%20of%20clients#schedule) used to index during phase 1 | `int` | `40` |
| `p1_bulk_size` | The [build-size](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/track.html?highlight=number%20of%20clients#bulk) for the autogenerated events during phase 1 | `int` | `1000` |
| `p1_duration_secs` | Duration of phase 1 execution in sec | `int` | `7200` |
| `p2_bulk_indexing_clients` | Number of [clients](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/track.html?highlight=number%20of%20clients#schedule) used to index during phase 2 | `int` | `16` |
| `p2_bulk_size` | The [build-size](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/track.html?highlight=number%20of%20clients#bulk) for the autogenerated events during phase 2 | `int` | `1000` |
| `p2_ops` | Number of bulk indexing ops/s for phase 2. A value of `10` with `p2_bulk_size=10` throttles indexing to 10000 docs/s | `int` | `10` |
| `rollover_max_size` | Max index size condition for [rollover API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-rollover-index.html#indices-rollover-index) | `str` | `30gb` |
| `rollover_max_age` | Max age condition for [rollover API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-rollover-index.html#indices-rollover-index) | `str` | `1d` |
| `p2_query1_target_interval` | Frequency of execution (every N sec) of Kibana query: `kibana-traffic-country-dashboard_60m` | `int` | `30` |
| `p2_query2_target_interval` | Frequency of execution (every N sec) of Kibana query: `kibana-discover_30m` | `int` | `30` |
| `p2_query3_target_interval` | Frequency of execution (every N sec) of Kibana query: `kibana-traffic-dashboard_30m` | `int` | `30` |
| `p2_query4_target_interval` | Frequency of execution (every N sec) of Kibana query: `kibana-content_issues-dashboard_30m"` | `int` | `30` |
| `max_rolledover_indices` | Max amount of recently rolled over indices to retain | `int` | `20` |
| `index_pattern` | pattern to use for matching and deleting old rolled over indices. See also suffix_separator. | `str` | `elasticlogs_q-*` |
| `suffix_separator` | Separator for extracting suffix to help determining which rolled-over indices to delete  | `str` | `-` |

The indices use the alias `elasticlogs_q_write` and start with `elasticlogs_q-000001`. As an example, for a cluster with rolled over indices:  `elasticlogs-000001`, `elasticlogs-000002`, ... `000010` a value of `max_rolledover_indices=8` results to the removal of `elasticlogs-000001` and `elasticlogs-000002`.

A value of `max_rolledover_indices=20` on a three node bare-metal cluster with [these specifications](https://elasticsearch-benchmarks-internal.elastic.co/app/kibana#/visualize/edit/02c3be00-8a66-11e8-8558-f33069e7a81e?_g=()&_a=(filters:!(),linked:!f,query:(language:lucene,query:(query_string:(analyze_wildcard:!t,query:'*'))),uiState:(),vis:(aggs:!(),params:(fontSize:12,markdown:'%23%23%23%20Benchmarking%20Methodology%0A%0AAll%20benchmarks%20are%20run%20by%20Rally%20against%20the%20Elasticsearch%20latest%20snapshot%20as%20of%20the%20start%20date.%20Each%20benchmark%20runs%20for%2030%20days.%0A%0AThe%20benchmark%20uses%20four%20machines.%20On%20one%20we%20run%20the%20benchmark%20driver%20(Rally),%20on%20the%20other%20three%20the%20benchmark%20candidates.%0A%0AThe%20Elasticsearch%20node%20uses%20default%20settings%20except%20for:%0A%0AAdapted%20JVM%20settings:%0A%0A*%20Heap%20is%20increased%20to%208GB%20(%60-Xms8G%20-Xmx8G%60)%0A*%20Assertions%20are%20enabled%20(%60-ea%60)%0A*%20GC%20log%20is%20enabled%20(rolling)%0A%0AAdapted%20Elasticsearch%20settings:%0A%0A*%20%60network.host:%200.0.0.0%60%0A*%20%60bootstrap.memory_lock:%20true%60%0A%0AWe%20also%20run%20this%20node%20with%20the%20following%20plugins:%0A*%20x-pack%20(authentication%20backed%20by%20a%20file%20store%20%2B%20SSL%20enabled%20with%20self-signed%20certificates)%0A*%20ingest-geoip%0A%0AAll%20benchmarks%20are%20run%20on%20a%20bare%20metal%20machine%20with%20the%20following%20specifications:%0A%0A*%20CPU:%20Intel(R)%20Core(TM)%20i7-6700%20CPU%20@%203.40GHz%0A*%20RAM:%2032%20GB%0A*%20SSD:%20Crucial%20MX200%0A*%20OS:%20Linux%20Kernel%20version%204.13.0-38%0A*%20OS%20tuning:%0A%20%20*%20Turbo%20boost%20disabled%20(%60%2Fsys%2Fdevices%2Fsystem%2Fcpu%2Fintel_pstate%2Fno_turbo%60)%0A%20%20*%20THP%20at%20default%20%60madvise%60%20(%60%2Fsys%2Fkernel%2Fmm%2Ftransparent_hugepage%2F%7Bdefrag,enabled%7D%60)%0A*%20JVM:%20Oracle%20JDK%201.8.0_131%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Benchmark%0A%0AThese%20benchmarks%20run%20the%20%5Bcontinuous%20index%20and%20query%20challenge%5D(https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdliappis%2Frally-eventdata-track%2Fblob%2Flongrun-benchmarks%2Feventdata%2Fchallenges%2Felasticlogs-continuous-index-and-query.json)%20from%20the%20%5Brally-eventdata-track%5D(https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdliappis%2Frally-eventdata-track%2Ftree%2Flongrun-benchmarks)%20with%20the%20following%20parameters:%0A%0A%60%60%60%0A%7B%0A%20%20%22number_of_replicas%22:%201,%0A%20%20%22shard_count%22:%203,%0A%20%20%22p1_bulk_indexing_clients%22:%2032,%0A%20%20%22p1_bulk_size%22:%201000,%0A%20%20%22p1_duration_secs%22:%2028800,%0A%20%20%22p2_bulk_indexing_clients%22:%2012,%0A%20%20%22p2_bulk_size%22:%201000,%0A%20%20%22p2_ops%22:%2030,%0A%20%20%22max_rolledover_indices%22:%2020,%0A%20%20%22rollover_max_size%22:%20%2230gb%22%0A%7D%0A%60%60%60',type:markdown),title:'Benchmarking%20Methodology%20v2',type:markdown))) ends up consuming a constant of `407GiB` per node.

It is recommended to store any track parameters in a json file and pass them to Rally using `--track-params=./params-file.json`. Example content:

``` shell
$ cat params-file.json
{
  "number_of_replicas": 1,
  "shard_count": 3,
  "p1_bulk_indexing_clients": 32,
  "p1_bulk_size": 1000,
  "p1_duration_secs": 28800,
  "p2_bulk_indexing_clients": 12,
  "p2_bulk_size": 1000,
  "p2_ops": 30,
  "max_rolledover_indices": 20,
  "rollover_max_size": "30gb"
}
```

## Custom parameter sources

### elasticlogs\_bulk\_source

This parameter source generated bulk indexing requests filled with auto-generated data. This data is generated based on statistics from a subset of real traffic to the elastic.co website. Data has been anonymised and post-processed and is modelled on the format used by the Filebeat Nginx Module.

The generator allows data to be generated in real-time or against a set date/tine interval. A sample event will contain the following fields:

```
{
  "@timestamp": "2017-06-01T00:01:08.866644Z",
  "offset": 7631775,
  "user_name": "-",

      },
      "referrer": "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/marvel/current/getting-started.html",

    }
  }
}
```

### elasticlogs\_kibana\_source

This parameter source supports simulating two different types of dashboards.

**traffic** - This dashboard contains 7 visualisations and presents different types of traffic statistics. In structure it is similar to the `Nginx Overview` dashboard that comes with the Filebeat Nginx Module. It does aggregate across all records in the index and is therefore a quite 'heavy' dashboard.

![Eventdata traffic dashboard](eventdata/dashboards/images/eventdata_traffic_dashboard.png)

**content\_issues** - This dashboard contains 5 visualisations and is designed to be used for analysis of records with a 404 response code, e.g. to find links that are no longer leading anywhere. This only aggregates across a small subset of the records in an index and is therefore considerably 'lighter' than the **traffic** dashboard.

![Eventdata content issues dashboard](eventdata/dashboards/images/eventdata_content_issues_dashboard.png)

**discover** - This simulates querying data through the `Discover` application in Kibana.

## Extending and adapting

This track can be used as it is, but was designed so that it would be easy to extend or modify it. There are two directories named **operations** and **challenges**, containing files with the standard components of this track that can be used as an example. The main **track.json** file will automatically load all files with a *.json* suffix from these directories. This makes it simple to add new operations and challenges without having to update or modify any of the original files.

## Elasticsearch Compatibility

This track requires Elasticsearch 6.x. Earlier versions are not supported.

## Versioning Scheme

From time to time, setting and mapping formats change in Elasticsearch. As we want to be able to support multiple versions of Elasticsearch, we also need to version track specifications. Therefore, this repository contains multiple branches. The following examples should give you an idea how the versioning scheme works:

- master: tracks on this branch are compatible with the latest development version of Elasticsearch
- 6: compatible with all Elasticsearch 6.x releases.
- 2: compatible with all Elasticsearch releases with the major release number 2 (e.g. 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1)
- 1.7: compatible with all Elasticsearch releases with the major release number 1 and minor release number 7 (e.g. 1.7.0, 1.7.1, 1.7.2)

As you can see, branches can match exact release numbers but Rally is also lenient in case settings mapping formats did not change for a few releases. Rally will try to match in the following order:

1. major.minor.patch-extension_label (e.g. 6.0.0-alpha2)
2. major.minor.patch (e.g. 6.2.3)
3. major.minor (e.g. 6.2)
4. major (e.g. 6)

Apart from that, the master branch is always considered to be compatible with the Elasticsearch master branch.

To specify the version to check against, add `--distribution-version` when running Rally. It it is not specified, Rally assumes that you want to benchmark against the Elasticsearch master version.

Example: If you want to benchmark Elasticsearch 6.2.4, run the following command:

```
esrally --distribution-version=6.2.4
```

How to Contribute
-----------------

If you want to contribute to this track, please ensure that it works against the master version of Elasticsearch (i.e. submit PRs against the master branch). We can then check whether it's feasible to backport the track to earlier Elasticsearch versions.
